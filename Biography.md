## Biography
Hi, my name is João Rebelo Pinto. This biography is an overview of my life path until now, and what led me to create a Data Analytics Portfolio.

I have always been a type of person that is in love with order and simplicity. A clean minimalist looking living room over a busy looking wall full of books and knick-knacks, a clean and organized desktop instead of some monstruosity where you can't even see the background,- or a well spaced and good looking SQL query instead of a disorganized mess that is difficult to follow. But unfortunately, the world is not made of right angles and blank surfaces; it's a messy place, and that can sometimes feel chaotic and overwhelming. So imagine my hapiness when I found out that there people who dedicate their careers to finding order within that chaos. That is how I was introduced to the world of data analytics: to navigate a chaotic world and be able to sift through that chaos, and find the answer to your questions by making data-driven decisions. If I was aware of this when I was younger, I believe my career so far would've been very different.

At 19 I to enrolled in a Bachelors degree for Cinema, Video and Multimedia Communication in my hometown (Lisbon), choosing to pursue my passion without any regard to what my future would look like. 4 years later, with a university diploma, 1 year of work experience in cinema post-production and nothing to lose, I decided to take a leap of faith: move to London with only a plane ticket and a room to stay in. At the time - although risky - this was a decision that made sense to me, as London is one of the world's capitals of post-production, I spoke fluent English, and it wasn't too far from home in case of emergency. In a way this was a data-driven decision, I just didn't know it at the time.

Fast forward 10 years into today. Now with a family and a very different perspective of the world, I feel like my career in the film industry, although productive and fascinating, has come to an end. I started looking for a new "home" career wise, and that's when Data Analytics came into my life. With the help of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I have realised how vast this field is, and that I'm particulary interested in the aspects of Data Engineerin and the use of SQL and Python to clean, manipulate, and analyze data to answer any type of questions that may come my way.

Hopefully this has given you some insight into my path. I'm always free to connect and talk more, in case you are interested in any more details about my path.

Thank you for reading.

  
With best regards,

João Rebelo Pinto
